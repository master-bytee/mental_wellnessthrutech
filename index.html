        <h2>Why This Project Works</h2>
        <p>This mental health wellness app aims to provide teens with tools to track their moods, practice gratitude, and access helpful resources in a user-friendly way. It encourages mindfulness and self-care, which are crucial for emotional well-being during adolescence.
        Gratitude journals and mood trackers are invaluable tools for managing mental health disorders by fostering self-awareness and positivity. Gratitude journals
             encourage individuals to reflect on positive experiences and cultivate a mindset of appreciation, which can counteract negative thought patterns. On the 
             other hand, mood trackers provide insights into emotional patterns and triggers, enabling better self-management and informed discussions with healthcare providers. Together, these tools promote mindfulness, emotional regulation,
             and a sense of control over one's mental well-being, making them effective in supporting individuals dealing with various mental health challenges.<br></p><style>
